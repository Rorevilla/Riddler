### Riddler Express 07/24/2020

Taken from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-you-a-pinball-wizard/).

>Riddler Township is having its quadrennial presidential election. Each of the town’s 10 “shires” is allotted a certain number of electoral votes: two, plus one additional vote for every 10 citizens (rounded to the nearest 10).<br/>[...]<br/>If there are two candidates running for president of Riddler Township, and every single citizen votes for one or the other, then what is the lowest >percentage of the popular vote that a candidate can get while still winning the election?

I will use a brute force method in order to solve this problem. I will consider all the possible combinations for the ten Shires. Each one of them has two possible outcomes (vote for candidate A or candidate B), making a total of  $2^{10}$ = 1,024 combinations 

First, all the necesarry libraries are imported
```{r eval=FALSE}

library(R.utils)    #for binary conversion
library(magrittr)   #pipping
library(tidyverse)  #dplyr, ggplot, etc
library(hrbrthemes) #custom theme for ggplot
library(cowplot)    #adding grobs to ggplot

```

```{r include=FALSE}

library(R.utils)    #for binary conversion
library(magrittr)   #pipping
library(tidyverse)  #dplyr, ggplot, etc
library(hrbrthemes) #custom theme for ggplot
library(cowplot)    #adding grobs to ggplot

```

A dataframe containing information for each Shire is generated
```{r}
shire <- c("Oneshire","Twoshire","Threeshire","Fourshire","Fiveshire","Sixshire","Sevenshire","Eightshire","Nineshire","Tenshire")
population <- c(11,21,31,41,51,61,71,81,91,101)
votes <- c(3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12)
shires <- data.frame(shire,population,votes)
shires %<>% mutate(votes_to_win_shire = population%/%2+1)
shires
```

A dataframe containing all posible combinations is generated. 1 represents a candidate and 0 represent his opponent. when the Shire's electoral votes go towards a candidate, the majority of its popular votes go towards said candidate. Otherwise, the candidate receives 0 popular votes from that particular shire. 
```{r output=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
numbers <- 0:1023
combinations <- as.data.frame(numbers) %>% mutate(binary = intToBin(numbers),numbers=NULL)
combinations%<>% separate(binary,into=paste0("s", seq(1:10)),sep = "(?<=.)")
combinations%<>% mutate(total_electoral_votes = ifelse(s1==1,votes[1],0)+
                                                ifelse(s2==1,votes[2],0)+
                                                ifelse(s3==1,votes[3],0)+
                                                ifelse(s4==1,votes[4],0)+
                                                ifelse(s5==1,votes[5],0)+
                                                ifelse(s6==1,votes[6],0)+
                                                ifelse(s7==1,votes[7],0)+
                                                ifelse(s8==1,votes[8],0)+
                                                ifelse(s9==1,votes[9],0)+
                                                ifelse(s10==1,votes[10],0))
#In order for a candidate to win, he has to have the majority of the electoral votes:
combinations %<>% filter(total_electoral_votes > Reduce("+",votes)%/%2)
combinations%<>% mutate(total_population_votes = ifelse(s1==1,population[1]%/%2+1,0)+
                                                  ifelse(s2==1,population[2]%/%2+1,0)+
                                                  ifelse(s3==1,population[3]%/%2+1,0)+
                                                  ifelse(s4==1,population[4]%/%2+1,0)+
                                                  ifelse(s5==1,population[5]%/%2+1,0)+
                                                  ifelse(s6==1,population[6]%/%2+1,0)+
                                                  ifelse(s7==1,population[7]%/%2+1,0)+
                                                  ifelse(s8==1,population[8]%/%2+1,0)+
                                                  ifelse(s9==1,population[9]%/%2+1,0)+
                                                  ifelse(s10==1,population[10]%/%2+1,0))
```

The optimal scenario is selected, by slicing the rows in the dataframe with the lowest number of popular votes. This results in 6 scenarios, where the winning candidate has 38 electoral votes (just over 50%) and a whooping 24.3% of popular votes.
```{r}
#Optimal combination(s) selected
combinations %>% top_n(n = -1, wt = total_population_votes)
136/Reduce("+",population)*100
```
 Information is added to the six "optimal" scenarios, including the names of the shires, their population, etc.
 

```{r output=FALSE,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
solutions <- combinations %>% top_n(n = -1, wt = total_population_votes)
solutions  %<>%  mutate(solution_number = row_number())
solutions %<>% select(-total_electoral_votes,-total_population_votes) %>% gather(key="shire",value="winner",-solution_number)
solutions   %<>%  mutate(shire=recode_factor(shire,s1="Oneshire",s2="Twoshire",s3="Threeshire",s4="Fourshire",s5="Fiveshire",s6="Sixshire",
                                           s7="Sevenshire",s8="Eightshire",s9="Nineshire",s10="Tenshire"))
solutions  %<>% left_join(shires %>% select(shire,electoral_votes=votes,votes_to_win_shire,population))
solutions  %<>%  mutate(label=paste(ifelse(winner==1,votes_to_win_shire,0),"/",population,"\n",ifelse(winner==1,electoral_votes,0),"/",electoral_votes))

```
 
Finally, the scenarios are plotted and saved.
```{r output=FALSE, warning =FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Producing base plot
a <- solutions %>% ggplot(aes(x=shire,y=as.character(solution_number),fill=winner))+
  geom_tile(color="white",size=1)+
  ggthemes::scale_fill_tableau(name = "Shire Winner", labels = c("Candidate A", "Candidate B"))+
  labs(x="Shire",y="Scenario")+
  geom_text(aes(label=label),size=3,color="white")+
  coord_fixed()+
  theme_ipsum_rc()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,hjust = 1))+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(hjust = 0, vjust=0, colour="darkgrey",size=12,face="bold"))+
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(hjust = 0, vjust=3, colour="darkgrey",size=12,face="bold"))
